# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `1>How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?`

I have used create-react boiler plate for initial setup and have installed @material/Ui for components and react-router-dom for routing page.

In this project there is basic page where you will find 2 card section series and movies. On click it will redirect to that page and load list of data using fetch API.

I have also build 3 page where it will display some content of specific click on the list.

### `2>Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?`

Yes, definately we can make a login and make footer links working .
Add pagination for listing movies and series.
In the movies and series section we can connect to actual API and show genuine data with trailers and videos and also complete description of this content.

### `What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?`

Yes,I will connect to TMDB database and fetch actual data and display on it .
Also add Redux for state management and proper loader and animations.

Will also make user to login and comment to thier favorite movies or series
